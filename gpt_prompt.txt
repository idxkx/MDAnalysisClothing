 
用详细的描述词汇来描述图片中的服装细节，并以json格式返回，我会解析内容后用于文字生成服装场景，希望追求高还原度。

描述服装的要求：
1.描述图片中上衣细节，用于文生图提示词，追求与原图的还原
2.只描述上衣或者外套，忽略内搭、内衣、裤子
3.必须明确上衣类型
4.忽略背景、人物、手、衣服撑，忽略上衣以外一切事物，聚焦上衣特征描述
5.扣子需要描述数量与颜色
6.拉链需要描述拉链颜色
7.口袋需要描述大小、位置、形状、是否外露形状
8.衣领需要描述特征
9.袖子需要描述长短
10.颜色描述需要洗知道什么部位什么颜色
11.服装的装饰图案，描述位置、大小、分布、密度
12.不能忽略衣服相连接的飘带、拉绳、金属装饰描述
